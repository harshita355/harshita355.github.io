  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    Hi! I’m <strong>Harshita</strong>, a passionate Computer Science & Data Science (CSDS) student.  
    I love learning about technology, coding, web development, data science, and building creative digital projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy exploring areas like:  
    <ul>
      <li>Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)</li>
      <li>Data Science basics</li>
      <li>Git & GitHub for version control</li>
      <li>Programming in Python and C/C++</li>
      <li>UI/UX and responsive design</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    This website is one of my practice projects where I’m learning how to host static sites using 
    <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> and manage code using branches and pull requests.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe in learning by doing, and every small project helps me grow better as a developer.  
    Thanks for visiting my website! 😊
