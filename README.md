# My First GitHub Pages Website 🌐

This repository contains my first simple website hosted using **GitHub Pages**.  
It includes the following files:
- `index.html` → Home page  
- `about.html` → About Me page  
- `style.css` → Styling file  
I created this as part of **Experiment 1: Git and GitHub** in my Web Technologies Lab.
